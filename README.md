# Hacker News Web App

## Purpose

My high school just ended, it is a terrible experience for me. All my skills are developed by self-learning, not from school.

Anyway, it has ended, to celebrate this I give myself a "hackathon", recreate a web app in 8-12 hours, not a lot of time because I'm in charge of prom pictures.

Here is the result, animation is using some experimental features so might not work on all browsers.
